Problem Overview
  Problem Title: Cisco ISR 1100 IP Misconfig
  Date/Time of Problem: 08/10/2025		11:00PM
  Device Name: Cisco ISR 1100 series
  Device Type/OS: Router/Cisco
  Steps to Reproduce: 
    show ip interfaces brief
    Enter into global config mode: 
      enable
      configure terminal
    interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0
    no ip address dhcp	(disables dhcp client functionality)
    ip address <new IP (in this case: 192.168.0.#)> <new subnet mask>	(Assigns new static IP)
    exit
    show ip interfaces brief            (check to see if the new IP was assigned)
    copy running-config startup-config 	(save config)

Problem Details
  Symptoms: I can't access the web interface when I enter the new IP address (192.168.0.#) of the Cisco ISR 1100
  Impact: Cisco ISR 1100

Establish a Theory of Probable Cause
  Initial Hypothesis: Misconfigured IP address
  Reasoning:
    After I changed the IP address of the router I reloaded the webpage (previous IP: 192.168.1.#, & new IP: 192.168.0.#) I couldn't access the webpage. “Site can't be reached” 
    The IP that I configured for GigabitEthernet0/0/0 (192.168.0.#) was not on Network-A 192.168.1.0/24

Test the Theory to Determine the Cause
  Tests Performed:
    I Ping the New IP(192.168.0.#) of the Cisco ISR 1100
    Tracert 192.168.0.#
    I logged into Net-A-Router to check if the ISR 1100 was connected
  Test Results:
    ping & tracert results: Host unreasonable
    In the Web UI for Net-A-router i checked the connected device tab the ISR 1100 wasn't connected (offline)

Establish a Plan of Action
  Connect to the switch by console & configure GigabitEthernet0/0/0 to receive IP address from DHCP server

Troubleshooting & Solution
  Solution Implemented:
    Connect to Cisco ISR 1100 series via console using Putty
    Enter in Global Config mode: enable > configure terminal (conf t for short)
    show ip interfaces brief
    interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0		(selects specified interface)
    ip address dhcp		                (set interface to get IP from DHCP server)
    exit
    show ip interface brief            (display IP of the interface vefify the new ip)
    copy running-config startup-config		(saves config)
    Date & Time of Implementation: 08/10/2025 12:30PM

Verification:
Entered the Cisco ISR 1100 IP address obtained from the DHCP server (192.168.1.#) in a web browser and I was able to access the Web UI of the router

Notes
  Save configurations
  If a static IP address was configured on an interface, you might need to remove it with no ip address <ip_address> <subnet_mask>

Key
Cisco ISR 1100 			192.168.1.#
Network-A		    		192.168.1.0/24
