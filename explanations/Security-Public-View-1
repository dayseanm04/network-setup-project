# Virtual Local Area Network is used to segement networks(divides the network in virtual area networks).

example 1: see below
this is an example of a network without VLAN's: lets call this Network-G

#       Device 1    Device 2      Device 3              #
#       Device 4    Device 5      Device 6              #
#       Device 7    Device 8      Device 9              #
#       Device 10   Device 11     Device 12             #

Disadvantages:
*  Broadcast traffic overload: every device will recieve a broadcast. this increases traffic and slow down the network
*  Every device can communicate with each other if Device 1 is infecred will malware it can spread to the other devices
*  Difficult to troubleshoot since every device is on one network
*  No scalability when more devices are added to the network, it can/will degrade the performance
*  Managing the network become more complex
*  No traffic segementation you cant seperate employee traffic from quest traffic

example 2: see below
this is an example of a network with VLAN's: lets call this Network-Z

#      Device 1   | Device a   |   Device 5            #
#      Device 2   | Device b   |   Device 6            #
#      Device 3   | Device c   |   Device 7            #
#      Device 4   | Device d   |   Device 8            #

Advantages:
*  Better performance because were reducing the broadcast traffic by limitting the boadcast domain
*  Good security: Devices can only communicate with devices in the same VLAN
*  For devices to communcite with devices in other VLAN, I will have to configure routing, Switch Virtual Interface & use a L3 switch
*  Logical grouping of devices: group devices based on roles & functions (finance, IT, HR etc)
*  Makes troubleshooting easier
*  Easy to manage permissions, policies, QoS for each VLAN
*  Guest Isoation: create a VLAN for quest users
