Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

For you to configure a switch or a router using the Web interface, you will have to type the IP address of the switch in a web 
browser and it will take you there it does that using HTTP. HTTP is unsecured it trasmit data in the clear(unencrypted). so when you
you type in your username and password it can be intercepted with a tool like wire shark


That is why HTTPS was created Hypertext Transfer Protocol "SECURED".
HTTPs encrypts data with Trasport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Socket Layer(SSL), so that no one cant intercept and username and password
